              Due to a varied levels of income throughout states and within
              local communities, education funding suffers from inequalities
              where some communities have excessive funding and others are
              lacking important resources to support students. According to the
              research on Equity and Adequacy in School Funding, much of the
              current litigation and legislative activity in education funding
              seeks to assure adequacy.
            </p>
            <p>
              Because income and tax revenue varies so widely from district to
              district, the current school funding model has led to a huge
              disparity in the funding that schools in different parts of a
              single state receive.
            </p>
            <p>
              Primarily, schools in affluent areas receive more funding as
              compared to those located in low-income areas.
